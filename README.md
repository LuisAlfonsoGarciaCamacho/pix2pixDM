Mapping the Invisible: A Pix2Pix-inspired Approach to Real Galactic Dark Matter Distributions

At the 2022 National Physics Congress, we had the privilege of sharing our research, which delved into the fascinating realm of cosmological simulations and predictive modeling. Our study hinged on the rich dataset extracted from the ILLUSTRIS simulation, a computational marvel that simulates the evolution of the universe, providing detailed insights into the distribution of dark matter and baryonic matter.

The core of our investigation revolved around the meticulous analysis of density maps, capturing the intricate structures of both dark matter, the mysterious substance that constitutes a significant portion of the universe's mass, and baryonic matter, the familiar building blocks of galaxies. These high-resolution maps served as the canvas upon which we applied cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

To enhance our predictive capabilities, we embraced a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), a powerful neural network architecture known for its ability to generate realistic data. Our GAN was carefully crafted based on the pix2pix model, a pioneering approach in image-to-image translation. It underwent training on the dual datasets of dark matter and baryonic matter density maps, learning the complex relationships embedded in the simulated data.

The crux of our presentation lay in the innovative application of this trained GAN to real-world scenarios. We aimed to bridge the gap between simulation and observation, employing the GAN to make predictions for dark matter density maps in actual galaxies. This not only pushed the boundaries of our understanding of the cosmic landscape but also showcased the potential of machine learning in predicting and interpreting observational data in astrophysics.

In essence, our work not only contributes to the ongoing dialogue in the field of cosmology but also underscores the symbiotic relationship between state-of-the-art simulations, advanced machine learning methodologies, and real-world astronomical observations. We believe that our findings pave the way for exciting possibilities in predictive modeling and computational astrophysics, marking a significant step forward in our quest to unravel the mysteries of the universe.
